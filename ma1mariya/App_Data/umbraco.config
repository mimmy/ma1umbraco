        <articleContents><![CDATA[<p><span>If you’re aiming to agree a fixed price for the development of the website, as we do, ensure the project goes smoothly before you start, by communicating with your client at the outset. They’ll appreciate you for it, there will be less surprises, and you may be able to start making a profit from </span><a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/wordpress-development-company/">fixed cost website design</a><span> jobs again.</span></p>
<p>Here’s stuff that needs to be discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prices can change even for a fixed cost website</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/how-much-does-a-website-cost/">Web Design Costs</a> are dependent on how many hours is spent working on a design and how many times the client asks for changes to it</li>
<li>Show the client your portfolio – that is the type of sites you build, do they like it?</li>
<li>Has the client supplied examples of the sort of site they are looking for?</li>
<li>Estimate a cost for a job, based on early discussion.</li>
<li>Ensure the client knows you can quote for a job only on the information you have available to you at the time</li>
<li>Confirm a job cost on reviewed client requirements</li>
<li>50% of job before start, 50% on completion</li>
<li>Ensure the client knows you are costing the job by hours and you do have other clients</li>
<li>Make sure all your costs are approved before starting a job (remember VAT)</li>
<li>Ask the client to send you an email notifying his acceptance of the project scope and cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>It’s impossible to make a site that will look the same in all browsers;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Specify which <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/best-screen-size/">Resolution / Screen Size the Website Should Be Designed to</a></li>
<li>Specify a fixed width or fluid layout</li>
<li>Inform the client which <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/ie-test/">browser versions you support</a></li>
<li>Ensure the client is aware of <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/design-website-for-blind/#what-s-the-best-font-font-size-to-use-in-website-design-">website font restrictions or recommendations</a> and <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/">web page download considerations</a></li>
<li>Ensure the client is aware websites look different than on paper</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Content should be supplied by the client in a form easily used</strong>
<ul>
<li>Who is supplying the text?</li>
<li>Who is supplying the images?</li>
<li>Get the client to supply all text, photographs and content in electronic format</li>
<li>Make sure text supplied, if formatted, is in a web-ready format</li>
<li>The client should supply an example site-plan, in a bulleted list</li>
<li>The client needs to specify any specific functionality required at the outset</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>‘Milestone’ dates for the project should be agreed</strong>
<ul>
<li>Communicate missing any milestone date for supplying content / adding new content will have an impact on launch commitments and costs – both of you have businesses to run</li>
<li>Agree content delivery date</li>
<li>Agree Site Architecture Freeze Date</li>
<li>Agree Site Functionality Freeze Date</li>
<li>Agree Design Freeze date</li>
<li>Agree Launch Date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Changes to the brief should be communicated and costs agreed / timings considered in electronic form</strong>
<ul>
<li>No Favours – The road to hell is paved with good intentions and the bodies of well meaning web developers</li>
<li>Everything should be charged out, agreed and accountable<strong><br /></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Websites can go down every now and then</strong>
<ul>
<li>Who hosts the current site?</li>
<li>Get Contact Details</li>
<li>Hosting is a recurring annual charge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Domain transfers sometimes go a bit Pete Tong</strong>
<ul>
<li>You are at the mercy of third parties</li>
<li>Who controls current domain(s)?</li>
<li>Domains need registered every year</li>
<li>Get Contact Details</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Emails might go down for a period of perhaps 24-48 hours</strong>
<ul>
<li>Who controls current email(s)?</li>
<li>Get Contact Details</li>
<li>How many email accounts to you have/need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Launching a website can be about pressing buttons andÃ¢â‚¬¦. waiting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Websites Get Hacked</strong>
<ul>
<li>All CMS needs kept up to date</li>
<li>In most cases hackers seek to deface the site</li>
<li>A hacked site can mean disaster in Google</li>
<li>A site that has been hacked can be rescued</li>
<li>Who’s in charge of security / CMS updates</li>
<li>Agree maintenance fees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A Winning Website Is never ‘Finished’!</strong>
<ul>
<li>The client should keep his site up-to-date with news if he has a CMS</li>
<li>Training for the CMS should be costed if required</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A website is subject to Laws of The Land and the client should investigate these</strong>
<ul>
<li>The UK Companies Act</li>
<li>UK Distance Selling Regulations</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/design-website-for-blind/">Website Accessibility Recommendations</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Agree ongoing responsibilities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Who is responsible for the clientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s email, hosting and domain management</li>
<li>Do you ‘guarantee’ a website is fit for purpose for say 1 year?</li>
<li>When will annual billing start and occur</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m sure I’ve missed some things out, but I wanted a post on the site I could point my clients to, to educate them on some of the less talked about aspects of developing a website. I expect to modify this page every now and again.</p>
<p>Take responsibility, agree the scope of the project, recognise the requirements to meet the brief within allocated time-frame, and bill for your time.</p>
<p>I’ve learned this the hard way. Now I aim at all times to communicate with the client as much as possible to ensure any web development job doesn’t get out of control.</p>]]></articleContents>

        <articleContents><![CDATA[<p><span>Here’s 10 examples, off the top of my head, of conversations i have actually </span><em>had</em><span>when I have had to postpone a website launch and the client has asked </span><em>why</em><span>?…..</span></p>
<div class="entry">
<p>My answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The changes you sent to the design brief on Wednesday</li>
<li>The 150 images you sent to us yesterday to be included on the site</li>
<li>The 50 pages of text for the website you sent to us Tuesday…. in the post….. er, on paper</li>
<li>This is the first time your boss has seen it?</li>
<li>You never told us all your organisation used IE4</li>
<li>Yes, as we mentioned, 1024×768 won’t fit on your bosses smaller screen</li>
<li>What do you mean your logo is changing</li>
<li>So you’ve actually not got any content ready for sections 3,4,5,6 and 7?</li>
<li>Ah….. so you want sections 3,4,5 and 7 removed from the navigation….</li>
<li>The guy who controls your domain is leaving early today?</li>
</ol>
<p>The list could go on…… what I’ve learned to do is take some responsibility on to ensure I don’t repeat mistakes I should have learned from.</p>

        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p class="author">The Qantas homepage was in need of some love. There wasn’t scope for a full redesign, so I needed to work with what was already there and give it a bit of a facelift. I’ll take you through the refreshed homepage and how it was designed.</p>
<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>The goal of the Qantas homepage refresh was to modernise the aesthetic, improve the user experience and increase conversions on flight bookings. The tricky part was that there wasn’t scope for a back-end rebuild, so we simply had to work with what was already there and almost skin the front end into something new. The design didn’t need to be responsive as there is a separate mobile site. I’ll take you through the mobile site refresh in a separate case study.</p>
<p>Looking at the old homepage above, it’s clear that the goal was to fit everything above the fold. I suspect that it may have been a business or marketing requirement at the time. Somehow, the designer of the page managed to do it, which is actually pretty impressive. It must have been tricky as there are quite a few elements to fit on the page.</p>
<p class="nomargin">Because everything is above the fold, however, the page is quite busy and cluttered, making it difficult for users to find what they’re looking for. We used our findings from analytics and user feedback on the old Qantas homepage to help inform our new design.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A modular approach</h2>
<p>Since we needed to work with existing website elements, we decided to break things up into modules, prioritise them and sketch out ideas for each one and how they might be laid out on the page. We also came up with ideas for some simple new elements to improve the page. Here are the main modules:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Flight booking form</li>
<li>Hero banner</li>
<li>Promotions panel</li>
<li>Frequent Flyer login form</li>
<li>Flight offers (new)</li>
<li>Destination guides (new)</li>
</ul>
<p>When I sketch a new interface, I often like to draw components on paper and then cut them out and stick them onto a larger sheet of paper with Blu-Tack. Kind of like a UI jigsaw puzzle (as seen in the above sketches). It makes it easier to move things around and change certain parts of the interface without needing to re-sketch the rest of it repeatedly.</p>
<p>After blocking out the basic layout of the page we moved on to more detailed sketches of each module. I’ll go through the basic thought process behind each module design separately below.</p>

<p><strong>THE CLIENT</strong> for this project was a Romanian bakery in Denmark who had just opened their first confectionery. The most important requirement for the website was an option to order online. The client didn't want any login forms or online payment.</p>
<p><strong>OUR IDEA</strong> was to create an order form, in which the customer can choose the amount of cake from a field under each picture and view, edit and send his current order with a basic contact form. That way there's both a simple, visual way for the customer to order and the client keeps the simplicity of receiving the orders by email. BiaBakery found the solution very elegant and simple.</p>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong> that I came up with as the coder was to use HTML5 forms and php. The fields under the pictures belong to a form. I get the information from it and echo it inside the confirmation form so that it can be viewed and edited by the customer.</p>
<p>The system is now in use on <a href="http://biabakery.dk/" target="_blank">http://biabakery.dk</a>. To see more visit <a href="http://mimmy.me/biabakery/order.php" target="_blank">http://mimmy.me/biabakery</a></p>

<p><strong>THIS WORDPRESS THEME</strong> is the one I was using in my Polymer clay blog. It’s my first attempt for creating a child theme and it worked out pretty well. The theme is designed entirely by me for my main target group – creative teenagers who look for cute polymer clay tutorials or inspiring projects on the web. The blog was a part of a school project that ended in November, so it hasn’t been updated since, but the project was pretty successful. The number of visitors per day was constantly increasing and about 20% of them were regular visitors.</p>
